//! EL2 trap context: the saved-register frame and the small set of

//! Living outside `trap` itself breaks the type-level import cycles: every
//! `peripherals/*`, `banked`, `unaligned*`, `tracer`, `guest_bp`, and
//! `snapshot` module that only needs the register frame (and the `read_sysreg!`
//! accessor / `describe_ec` / `advance_elr` helpers) imports them from here
//! rather than reaching into the dispatcher.
